# Code Samples

This project is going to contain a variety of programs written in a variety of
languages, basically with the goal of teaching myself a bunch of new languages.

The current list of languages that I plan to have in here are as follows:

* bash
* C
* C++
* C#
* Clojure
* Dart
* Erlang
* Go
* Haskell
* Java
* JavaScript
* Kotlin
* Lua
* Perl
* PHP
* Powershell
* Python(3)
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* TypeScript
* Vala

Some of these I've never used before, so we'll see how they turn out.
