# Code Samples

This project is going to contain a variety of programs written in a variety of
languages, basically with the goal of teaching myself a bunch of new languages.

The current list of languages that I plan to have in here are as follows:

1. bash
2. C
3. C++
4. C#
5. Dart
6. Go
7. Java
8. JavaScript
9. Kotlin
10. Perl
11. PHP
12. Powershell
13. Python(3)
14. Ruby
15. Rust
16. Scala
17. TypeScript

Some of these I've never used before, so we'll see how they turn out.
