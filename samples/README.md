# Code Samples
This directory contains various code samples. The idea is that I'll try to create the same thing in each of the languages in this directoy.


## Current/Planned Examples
### 0. `hello`

The old fashioned hello world script. Decided it might be useful/traditional to include it.

### 1. `sqrt`

This script determines the square root of a number

### 2. `primality`

This script takes in a command line argument and attempts to determine if it a prime number

### 3. `table`

This script prints a multiplication table up to 10x10

### 4. `grep`

Basically simplistic `grep` functionality

### 5. `web`

This script will download a website (provided via CLI arg) and will count the number of links in it

### 6. `mongo`

This script will interact with mongoDB (full CRUD)

### 7. `threading`
 
This script will spin up threads to calculate the prime factorization of multiple CLI arguments together
Ex:
```$ threading 72 64 75
2^3 x 3^2    2^6    3 x 5^2
2^9 x 3^3 x 5^2
```

### 8. `web-server`

A simple web server. Should respond to GET requests (at least). We'll see how long it takes in some of the more basic languages (looking at you, C)
