# Code Samples
This directory contains various code samples. The idea is that I'll try to create the same thing in each of the languages in this directoy.


## Curent Examples
1. `sqrt`
    This script determines the square root of a number
2. `primality`
    This script takes in a command line argument and attempts to determine if it a prime number
3. `table`
    This script prints a multiplication table up to 10x10
